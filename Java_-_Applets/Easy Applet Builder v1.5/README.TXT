New since 1.4 : 
               - New interface :
 	          Easy Applet Builder has a completely new interface. 
                  It allows you to navigate quicly between an applet 
                  parameter, to navigate quicly between all applets 
                  and to get a preview or the HTML code at any time 
                  since the buttons 'Show preview' and 'HTML' remain 
                  visible when you customize an applet.

                     text, but the font used can be customize: You draw 
                     your own letters in an image file and the applet 
                     will read the letters and scroll the text.
