<p><font size="2">MenuScroll is designed to simulate a windows pop-up menu (the kind of
menu that appears when you right click on your desktop), and is<br>
used for site navigation (but with a little imagination it could also be used for
presentation). The applet will appear as two menus, the left menu (main) will always be
visible and drive all the other (sub) menus.<br>
