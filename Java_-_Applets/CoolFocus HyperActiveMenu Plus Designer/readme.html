<br>
<br>     Menu applets, by definition, have a lot of <PARAM> tags to be          
<br>     entered, which takes a lot of precise typing and patience. It's a      
<br>     laborious job, particularly with some of our heavyweight systems..     
<br>     like HyperActiveMenu Plus. HyperActiveMenu Plus Designer aims to       
<br>     take the pain out of the job by providing a simple step-by-step        
<br>     wizard-style creation system for placing HyperActiveMenu Plus on       
<br>     a web page. Just work through the 8 pages selecting the options        
<br>     you want, adding and arranging items graphically on the tree, and      
<br>     selecting documents to link to by choosing them from a standard        
<br>     file dialog.  A quick keystroke or button click previews the           
<br>     result in the built-in browser (or any external browser) and you       
<br>     can continue to click that button after any change to update the       
<br>     browser. When you have everything set up as you'd like it,             
<br>     HyperActiveMenu Plus Designer will create the entire HTML code         
<br>     for you automatically and either copy it to the clipboard (so          
<br>     that you can paste it into an existing web page) or create a web       
<br>     page for you.  You can even open a web page and have the code          
<br>     inserted at the point you choose. Best of all, HyperActiveMenu         
<br>     Plus Designer can read your web page at any time and reload all        
<br>     your settings from it, making it simple to change colors and add,      
<br>     edit or remove menu entries in seconds.                                
<br>
