The iSlide Pro Studio is a java application and an environment
for developing your website navigation files and pages.
An application is not applet. That means that it will not 
work if embedded in an HTML page. A java application, like 
any other programme, is designed to run on a single computer 
in a stand-alone fashion. A java application uses a stand-alone 
interpreter called a java viewer to run on the file system. 
It does not use a browser. The java viewer is part of the 
operating system and should already be present on your 
computer. For further information, please refer to the 
HTML documentation contained in this package or see below.

The package also contains a number of trial applets which
you may access via the documentation. The applets are
indeed applets, and therefore run in webpages and on
intranets. The applets are much more widely tested and
widely compatible than the development environment. This is
because you will only need the development environment on
your own computer, but the applets will have to stand the
test of being used by everyone who visits your website.
The applets are therefore JDK 1.0.2 compatible and can be
used on java-compatible versions of Netscape 3 and MSIE 3
as well as the later versions of these and other browsers.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR iSlide Pro Studio

The application has been optimised for a 800x600
screen. A smaller screen will not work. A larger one
is OK.

You must have Microsoft's java viewer version 4.79.2339 
or later installed in the main Windows directory (not
a sub-directory). The easiest way to ensure that this
is the case is to have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
(or higher) installed, as this installs the necessary 
software for you. It is not necessary to install the
Active Desktop components of MSIE 4.


USING OR TRYING OUT THE APPLETS

No special installation is required. After installing
iSlide Pro Studio, you will find a large amount of
HTML documentation included. Start any of this documentation
and you should find it easy to navigate to large selection
of demonstrations of the applets. iSlide Pro Studio can be
used for making further example implementations.


STARTING iSlide Pro Studio

This can only be started by clicking the icons created
on the Windows interface when installing it.
