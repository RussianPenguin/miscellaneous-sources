<br>
<br>     Menu applets, by definition, have a lot of <PARAM> tags to be          
<br>     entered, which takes a lot of precise typing and patience. It's a      
<br>     laborious job, particularly with some of our heavyweight systems..     
<br>     like TreeView Professional. TVP Designer aims to take the pain out     
<br>     of the job by providing a simple step-by-step wizard-style             
<br>     creation system for placing TreeView Professional on a web page.       
<br>     Just work through the 7 pages selecting the options you want,          
<br>     adding and arranging items graphically on the tree, and selecting      
<br>     documents to link to by choosing them from a standard file dialog.     
<br>      A quick keystroke or button click previews the result in the          
<br>     built-in browser (or any external browser) and you can continue        
<br>     to click that button after any change to update the browser. When      
<br>     you have everything set up as you'd like it, TVP Designer will         
<br>     create the entire HTML code for you automatically and either copy      
<br>     it to the clipboard (so that you can paste it into an existing web     
<br>     page) or create a web page for you.  You can even open a web page      
<br>     and have the code inserted at the point you choose. Best of all,       
<br>     TVP Designer can read your web page at any time and reload all         
<br>     your settings from it, making it simple to change colors and add,      
<br>     edit or remove menu entries in seconds.                                
<br>
