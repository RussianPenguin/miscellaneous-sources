<br>     Menu applets, by definition, have a lot of <PARAM> tags to be          
<br>     entered, which takes a lot of precise typing and patience. It's a      
<br>     laborious job, particularly with some of our heavyweight systems..     
<br>     like CoolStrip. CoolStrip Designer aims to take the pain out of        
<br>     the job by providing a simple step-by-step wizard-style creation       
<br>     system for placing CoolStrip on a web page. Just work through the      
<br>     8 pages selecting the options you want, adding and arranging items     
<br>     graphically on the tree, and selecting documents to link to by         
<br>     choosing them from a standard file dialog.  A quick keystroke or       
<br>     button click previews the result in the built-in browser (or any       
<br>     external browser) and you can continue to click that button after      
<br>     any change to update the browser. When you have everything set up      
<br>     as you'd like it, CoolStrip Designer will create the entire HTML       
<br>     code for you automatically and either copy it to the clipboard (so     
<br>     that you can paste it into an existing web page) or create a web       
<br>     page for you.  You can even open a web page and have the code          
<br>     inserted at the point you choose. Best of all, CoolStrip Designer      
<br>     can read your web page at any time and reload all your settings        
<br>     from it, making it simple to change colors and add, edit or remove     
<br>     menu entries in seconds.                                               
<br>
