<html><body>$A$D<P>Description$A$D<br>This applet is an evolved version of the basic 
Sirius$A$D<br>table applet. The major enhancement here is that the$A$D<br>data is read from a 
text file on the server. Thus not$A$D<br>restricting the number of rows, or requiring 
constant$A$D<br>updates to the html code. Once the html code is set up,$A$D<br>the file 
location is defined, the data file can be changed$A$D<br>or updated by other systems and the 
applet will$A$D<br>automatically pick up the latest data from the file each$A$D<br>time the 
page is accessed. Also just like the basic table$A$D<br>applet this applet will enhance the 
display of tabular$A$D<br>data with horizontal and vertical scrollbars. It also$A$D<br>contains 
sort functionality on each column, giving the$A$D<br>user the ability to re-sort the data as they 
wish without$A$D<br>having to re-fetch the data from a server process. The$A$D<br>applet will 
automatically size itself to the available area$A$D<br>given to it by the HTML form. (The WIDTH 
and$A$D<br>HEIGHT of the APPLET tag.)$A$D<br>$A$D<br>The applet is easy to use and 
highly configurable in$A$D<br>terms of colours, fonts etc.$A$D<br>The applet is easy to use and
