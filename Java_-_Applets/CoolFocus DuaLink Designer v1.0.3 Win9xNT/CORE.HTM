<br>     Configuring applets can be a laborious task, often requiring you       
<br>     to delve into the documentation to find out what a parameter does,     
<br>     what its name is, and what its options are.  While we pride            
<br>     ourselves on the range of customizable options we provide for our      
<br>     applets, the result is that you have more parameter names to deal      
<br>     with. DuaLink Designer aims to take the pain out of the job by         
<br>     providing a simple step-by-step wizard-style creation system for       
<br>     placing DuaLink on a web page. Just work through the 7 pages           
<br>     selecting the options you want, choosing color schemes, and            
<br>     selecting documents to link to by choosing them from a standard        
<br>     file dialog.  A quick keystroke or button click previews the           
<br>     result in the built-in browser (or any external browser) and you       
<br>     can continue to click that button after any change to update the       
<br>     browser. When you have everything set up as you'd like it,             
<br>     DuaLink Designer will create the entire HTML code for you              
<br>     automatically and either copy it to the clipboard (so that you         
<br>     can paste it into an existing web page) or create a web page for       
<br>     you.  You can even open a web page and have the code inserted at       
<br>     the point you choose. Best of all, DuaLink Designer can read your      
<br>     web page at any time and reload all your settings from it, making      
<br>     it simple to change colors and add, edit or remove menu entries        
<br>     in seconds.                                                            
<br>
