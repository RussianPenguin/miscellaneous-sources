<br>     Menu applets, by definition, have a lot of <PARAM> tags to be          
<br>     entered, which takes a lot of precise typing and patience. It's a      
<br>     laborious job, particularly with some of our heavyweight systems..     
<br>     like HotStrip Professional. HotStrip Professional Designer aims to     
<br>     take the pain out of the job by providing a simple step-by-step        
<br>     wizard-style creation system for placing HotStrip Professional on      
<br>     a web page. Just work through the 8 pages selecting the options        
<br>     you want, adding and arranging items graphically on the tree, and      
<br>     selecting documents to link to by choosing them from a standard        
<br>     file dialog.  A quick keystroke or button click previews the           
<br>     result in the built-in browser (or any external browser) and you       
<br>     can continue to click that button after any change to update the       
<br>     browser. When you have everything set up as youd like it, HotStrip     
<br>     Professional Designer will create the entire HTML code for you         
<br>     automatically and either copy it to the clipboard (so that you can     
<br>     paste it into an existing web page) or create a web page for you.      
<br>     You can even open a web page and have the code inserted at the         
<br>     point you choose. Best of all, HotStrip Professional Designer can      
<br>     read your web page at any time and reload all your settings from       
<br>     it, making it simple to change colors and add, edit or remove menu     
<br>     entries in seconds.                                                    
<br>
