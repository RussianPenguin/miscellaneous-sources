      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>TextClock</B> is a C++ CGI program which is meant to be 
        run from <A 
        href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/faq/textclock/q1.shtml">Server 
        Side Includes</A>. When this script is implemented, it can be used to 
        show browsers several variations of the current time and/or date. A <A 
        href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/textclock.shtml">Perl 
        Version</A> is also available. There are several downloading options 
        available below and more information on this script can be found in the 
        Readme file.</BLOCKQUOTE><A name=Readme>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The Readme files at Matt's Script Archive contain detailed 
        installation, configuration and usage instructions, which take you step 
        by step from placing the scripts on your system to using them in your 
        web pages. You should read these through and keep them by you when 
        setting up or installing any MSA script. It is probably not a bad idea 
        to print them out. Each compressed script package contains a plain text 
        version of the Readme file, however the links below will take you to 
        their HTML counterparts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>Simple Search can be downloaded in several different 
        formats, or you can even have it mailed to you as a uuencoded file. 
        Click on one of the links below to the appropriately compressed file and 
        download options will appear.</BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>Several scripts at Matt's Script Archive lend themselves 
        well to local working demonstrations. The TextClock is one of these and 
        the working demo of TextClock is available below. More examples of this 
        script in action can be found in the 'Scripts Around the World' section 
        of MSA. </BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>The Frequently Asked Questions Archive at MSA is the easiest 
        and fastest way to get help. It contains a list of the most commonly 
        asked questions as well as their answers. Check these out before you 
        seek other means of help, as your question may be answered here already.

      <BLOCKQUOTE>If you wish to see examples of Matt's Script Archive's CGI 
        scripts used around the internet, you only need to check the Scripts 
        Around the World section. See what the scripts look like in action on 
        real web pages, but be considerate as these are actual implementations.
