 * almost like normal std::string variables in your program.
 * Usage:
 * in your header file, declare your registry std::string variable:
 * \code
 * CRegStdString regvalue;
 * \endcode
 * next initialize the variable e.g. in the constructor of your class:
 * \code
 * regvalue = CRegStdString("Software\\Company\\SubKey\\MyValue", "default");
 * \endcode
 * this will set the registry value "MyValue" under HKEY_CURRENT_USER with path 
 * "Software\Company\SubKey" to the variable. If the key does not yet exist or
 * an error occured during read from the registry, a default
 * value of "default" is used when accessing the variable.
 * to avoid too much access to the registry the value is cached inside the object.
 * once the value is read, no more read accesses to the registry will be made.
 * this means the variable will contain a wrong value if the corresponding registry
 * entry is changed by anything else than this variable! If you think that could happen
 * then use 
 * \code
 * regvalue.read();
 * \endcode
 * to force a refresh of the variable with the registry.
 * a write to the registry is only made if the new value assigned with the variable
 * is different than the last assigned value.
 * to force a write use the method write();
 * another option to force reads and writes to the registry is to specify TRUE as the
 * third parameter in the constructor.
