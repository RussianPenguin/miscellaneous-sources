===================================================================
I)                       VERSIONS HISTORY
===================================================================

--> In 2.5:
  *) 5 new applets:
   - CyclingColorsText : This applet displays a text with letters 
      colors changing with time.
   - FontImageScrolling: This applet displays a scrolling text, 
      but the font used can be customize: You draw your own letters 
      in an image file and the applet will read the letters and 
      scroll the text.
   - Graph: This applet read data from a data text file and plots 
      the data on a graph.
   - Memory: A classic game: find the pairs.
   - Table: Draw a table with data from a data text file. You can 
      set the colors, a title row...


--> In 2.4 : 
  *) 6 new applets :
   - SoundPlayer : This applet provides an interface to play AU sound files. You give a list 
      of sound files and the user can play the clips. The user can choose a clip in the 
      list and click the play button to play it, you can play the next, the previous clip, or 
      stop the current one. The current clip name is scrolled from right to left. You can 
      activate the auto play if you want the first clip to be played when the applet starts.
   - ImageViewer : This applet provides an interface to view and slide images. You give a
      list of images and the user can view them. The user can choose an image in the list ,
      click to view the next or the previous one or activate the slide show. You can activate 
      the auto slide show if you want the slide show to start when the applet starts.
   - ScrollUpDown : Scroll a text vertically. You can set the text height, color, offset
   - ImagePointer : This applet displays an image which follows the mouse pointer when it   
      is over the applet area. You can decide whether this image is still visible or not when   
      the mouse pointer is out of the applet area.
   - ImageConvex2 : Do the same effect as ImageConvex, that is to say a convexity disc, 
      but the disc follows the mouse pointer over the image. You can set the disc radius and 
      convexity intensity.
   - ImageLight2 : Do the same effect as ImageLight, that is to say a light disc over an 
      image but the disc follows the mouse pointer when it is over the image. You can set the
      light color and the disc radius.

  *) Old applets upgrades :
      -WhoIsVisitor : The 'last visited page' used to contain ugly characters like '%'.
        The format string is better now.
      - All applets with link feature: All the applets now support FTP links, like 
       'ftp:login:pass:21@server.com' and recognize special characters in URLs.


--> In 2.31 : 
  *) Old applets upgrades :
      -WhoIsVisitor : you can now set the sender email. Sometimes mail severs need a valid email:
       If the server is on a certain domain name, 'domain.com' for instance, then an email
       something@domain.com is required.
      -All applets with mouseover sound feature : Until v2.3 the mouseover sound stops when 
       the mouse pointer exits out of the applet area. Because the mouse pointer can enter and 
       exit quickly, the mouseover sound was stopped quickly. Now, in this version, the 
       mouseover sound is played until the end.

  *) Bugs fixed :
      -MenuPopup : it was impossible to change the text color.


--> In 2.3 : 
  *) New applet : Polygons.
  *) Old applets upgrades :
       ImageLight : initial color is now set with an hexadecimal color, like #254532.
       ListLink and LoginBox : now works with frames.
       ImageExtend and ImageConvex : the values are now integers values, no more float.
  *) Bugs fixed :
       Bug in 'WhoIsVisitor'. The popup still remained.
       A few applets kept on displaying the popup to the TaijiSoftware site, even if 
       the software was registered. 


--> In 2.2 : 
  *) Because many people had troubles with the domain name to put in
     the GiveCode applet I decided to make the applets independent
     from the domain name like in the past.
     So : if you register the first time, launch the GiveCode applet
     by viewing 'GiveCode.htm' in a browser and enter the registration
     code in the field. You will get the registration code for all
     the applets.
     If you already have registered Applet Pack, just enter your old 
     registration code in the GiveCode applet field and get the code
     for the applets.

  *) 4 new applets : 
       CropImages2 : a new slide show between images.
       Puzzle : a small game 
       MenuFrame : a frame appears with a menu inside, useful to navigate 
       through your site
       MenuPopUp : a classic popup menu appears when the mouse is over the
       applet area.

--> In 2.0.0 : 
  *) Most of the applets have a lot of new parameters: the possibility
     to play sounds (on load, on mouse over, on click), to add a link
     on click, to add a small text when mouse over, to add a message
     in the status bar of the browser...
  *) The applet protection has changed: now the "pass" parameter becomes
     "registration_code" which depends on the domain name where the applet
     will stand. An additional applet, "GiveCode" give you the code, if
     you have a registered version.
     This have been made to avoid some people to copy the applets from a 
     domain and use them on another domain.

--> In 1.9.0 :
  *) 8 new applets.

--> In 1.6.0 :
  *) 4 new applets: GuestBook, LoginBox, Navigation, WhoIsVisitor.
  *) In ButtonLink, CheckBoxLink, RandomLink and ListLink the URLs
     can now be relative (for example: '/links/links.html').

--> In 1.2.2 :
  *) A new applet: StatusBarScroller, which scrolls a choosen text 
     in the status bar.
  *) No more window in the limited version, but applets can work
     only off-line.

--> In 1.1.2 :
  *) StarsText and StarsText2 can now display a scrollbar which let
     user set the speed animation (usefull because computer speed  
     is often different on different computers)


===================================================================
II)                       WHAT ARE APPLETS ?
===================================================================

Applets are composants you add to your web pages. Because they are
written in a programmation language they are more powerful than 
scripts like Visual Basic Script or Java Script. Applets are written
in Java, an universal language which allow you to use applets on any
web browser that includes a java interpreter. It's the case for most
of the actual browsers (like Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator...)
With Java Programming Security is maximum. Indeed applets can't read
or write on your hard disk or on the web server it stays. Applets can
only read images and sounds.


====================================================================
III)                          USER MODE        
====================================================================

First of all if you have never seen a java applet in your web browser
Java may be inactivated : you can set it in "internet options" or
"preferences".

When you want to add to your web page an applet of this pack, go to 
the corresponding directory and :
  - if you write html : copy the html fragment including the applet, 
    that is to say the text between the balises <applet and </applet>
  - if you use a html editor like FrontPage : load the html file 
    including the applet you want and copy the applet directly on the
    page and paste it on your page.
Next copy the .class file(s) in the same directory as the html file.
Then adjust the requiered parameters.


For each applet there is a text file which describes the parameters
and the defaults values (default value is used when you put a parameter)
When there is no default, you are obliged to set a value.  

Note : don't include too much applets on one page because your site will
become slow on old computers.

For most of the applets you can can choose an image as background. You
can also choose a color. This color must be input in hexadecimal format
This format is used in HTML to describe colors. So if you want to set
the background color the same as the color page, look at the HTML and
find the balise <body bgcolor="#00FFFF"> "#00ffff" is the color number.
For example red is "#ff0000", blue is "#0000ff" ...
To get the hexadecimal number of a color, use the "HexColor" applet in
HexColor directory. 

In this applet you can use JPG and GIF images (even animated gif 
sometimes the animation flickers, depending on the type of animation)
When the images used are not in the same directory as the html file,
put the relative path, for instance : "images/name.jpg", where "images" 
is the directory including "name.jpg".

VII)                             FAQ
=====================================================================

Q) Why is there a popup to your site although I've registered the 
   software ?
A) Read the section 'How to enter registration information' above

Q) I have added AU sounds but no sound is played
A) There are several AU sounds formats. A few of them are not the
   Netscape AU format, reconized by Java applets. The best way to
   get valid AU sounds is to use a wave to au converter. Several
   waves editors do this task. For instance : Cool Edit, found at
   http://www.cooledit.com

Q) I have put 2 (or more) applets on my Web page and it is very slow now !
A) It's not a good idea. You should not put more than one applet on a page.
   Moreover, although it looks speed on your page if you have a fast PC, it
   can be slow on older computer. 

Q) I have added the WhoIsVisitor applet to my page, but nothing happens,
   I don't receive any email. Why ?
A) Before using this applet you should check that a mail server stands
   on your domain name server and that it accepts connections. You can
   do this easily with Telnet :
   Launch telnet (in start menu, click execute, enter telnet, click ok)
   Click Connexion>remote host. Enter your domain name as the 'remote host'
   and 25 as the 'port'. About your domain name : For instance, if your
   web address is something like 'http://www.thing.com/john/index.html'
   then the correct domain name is 'www.thing.com'. So the domain name
   is the string after '//' and before the first '/' (if any).
   Now, click connect and wait for the answer. If the server answers something
   like 'connection refused' or 'no route to host' then WhoIsVisitor will
   not able to connect too. Otherwise, if you get a cool response then it will
   be ok. You can make a test: put WhoIsVisitor on your site, view your
   page on line and for the email. 

Q) I use WhoIsVisitor applet. I receive emails but sometimes the IP is 
   '127.0.0.1' and hostname is 'localhost'. Moreover the last visited page
   is sometimes blank. Why ?
A) Some people have firewalls: their connection is protected, so it is hard 
   to get their identity. That's why you get '127.0.0.1' and 'localhost'.
   The last visited page is blank when the visitor has not visited a page 
   before ! For instance the visitor could have typed the address directly
   in the address bar.

Q) Why doesn't any applet running ?
A) -Check that java is enable on your browser (see in 'internet options'
    or 'preferences' section)
   -Check that your browser version is 4.x or higher
